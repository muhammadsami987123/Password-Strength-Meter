## Overview

This is a web application built with Streamlit that helps you analyze the strength of your passwords and generate strong, secure passwords. It provides real-time feedback on password strength and offers a password generator for creating robust passwords.

## Features

- **Password Strength Analysis:** Evaluates the strength of a password based on length and character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols).
- **Password Strength Levels:** Provides clear feedback on password strength levels: Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, and Very Strong.
- **Password History (Session-Based):** Allows you to save passwords during the current session for temporary reference (note: this is session-based and not persistent for security reasons).
